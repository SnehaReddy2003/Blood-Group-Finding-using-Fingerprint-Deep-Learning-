# Blood-Group-Finding-using-Fingerprint-Deep-Learning-
The Blood Group Finding project is an innovative biometric-based healthcare system that identifies a personâ€™s blood group by analyzing fingerprint patterns. This uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on fingerprint images corresponding to various blood groups (A+, B+, O+, AB+, etc.).This  achieves contactless blood group identification.
